# Voter Scanning System (VSS)

This is a web-based application designed to manage and track voter information for a specific facility or election station. It provides tools for data management, searching, and marking voters for facility or station use only.

### Key Features

- **Data Import:** Easily import voter data from a CSV or EXCEL file.

- **Data Generation:** Generate mock voter data for testing purposes.

- **Efficient Search:** A real-time search bar with suggestions to quickly find voters by name or card number.

- **Data Exports:** The application can also export a worked on data to excel or pdf file format for further data usage.

- **Voter Status Tracking:** It keeps track of a voter's role, which can be **normal**, an **Agent**, or a **Referee**. A voter can only hold one of these three roles at a time. If the voter is an Agent, their station designation is shown. If they are a Referee, the system displays who they refereed.

- **Theming:** Supports both light and dark modes for a comfortable user experience.

### Getting Started

- **Select a Mode:** Choose between "Test" mode with generated data or "Drive" mode for a real facility with imported data.

- **Load Data:** In "Drive" mode, upload a CSV file with your voter list. In "Test" mode, use the slider to generate mock data.

- **Search and Mark:** Use the search bar to find a voter. Once found, their status can be updated.
